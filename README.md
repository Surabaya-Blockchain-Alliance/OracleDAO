## Overview

The Oracle contract serves as a decentralized data feed system for blockchain applications, particularly those running on the Planq network. This smart contract allows users to request and retrieve updated prices and random numbers, securely and reliably, without relying on external centralized sources.

## Problem Solved

Blockchain applications often need access to real-world data, but the blockchain by its very nature is isolated and cannot access this data directly. The Oracle contract addresses this fundamental problem by allowing smart contracts to retrieve external data in a decentralized manner. This is crucial for applications such as dynamic pricing in decentralized finance (DeFi), games, and various other use cases where external data is necessary to execute business logic.
